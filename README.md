### Hangman Game

A fun console-based **Hangman Game** where players guess a hidden word letter by letter. It features a colorful interface, random word selection, and ASCII art to display the hangman.

### **Features**:
- **Random Words**: Words are chosen randomly from a list.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Shows progress, incorrect guesses, and remaining attempts.
- **Dynamic Hangman Drawing**: Updates as incorrect guesses increase.
- **Win/Loss Scenarios**: Celebrate wins or reveal the correct word upon losing.
- **Replay Option**: Choose to play again after each game.

### **How It Works**:
1. Guess letters to uncover a randomly selected word.
2. Correct guesses reveal letters; incorrect guesses draw the hangman.
3. Win by guessing the word before running out of attempts; lose if the hangman is completed.
4. Replay or exit after each game.

A simple and engaging way to enjoy the classic Hangman game with a vibrant, replayable interface!
